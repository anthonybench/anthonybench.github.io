# **Sleepy's ToolBox**
*A GitHub Pages site for my personal development & creative resources*

<br />

## Welcome to my ToolBox!
<hr>

This project is a static site for me to store favorite color themes I've made, fonts I like, and other examples organized for quickly accessible reference. See the link under *Get Started*! ようこそ！

## Get Started 🚀
<hr>

Explore this [link](https://anthonybench.github.io) in your favorite browswer, and open up your developer tools to explore the source and take/examine what resource you need! I'm always adding new things to it!

<br />

## Usage ⚙
<hr>

In the header, you have 4 pages listed as nav-items:

`Docs` serves as the home page, and tabularizes documentation I frequently access.

`Fonts` displays a collection of my favorite fonts.

`Colors` showcases color pallets I've come up with.

`Forms` demonstrates different basic form components, which I find easy to forget.

`Configs` organizes some common dev utilities and config files I use.

<br />

## Technologies 🧰
<hr>

Nothing but [BootStrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/), as *GitHub Pages* hosting does not allow for really any backend support.


<br />

## Contribute 🤝
<hr>

Since this is a personal reference page, I don't intend to review pull requests, however am always open to suggestion. If you feel obliged to send a pull request and leave a comment explaining your idea, I'd be happy and open to constructive feedback! 😊
