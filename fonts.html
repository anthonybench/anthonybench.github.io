              As for us, we fall in with a Finnish guy who used to work as a lumberjack in Sweden.<br>
              He says that his lumberjack colleagues always got drunk at lunchtime and so he was constantly worried about being sawed in half.<br>
              Now he has a safer billet with the Texas National Guard.<br>
              Ironically but unsurprisingly, personal interactions at SXSW Interactive can be somewhat awkward.<br>
              At one party a British woman tackles my friend Phil, straddles him, and tries to draw a moustache on his face with a Magic Marker.<br>
              The strange thing is that Phil already has a moustache.<br>
